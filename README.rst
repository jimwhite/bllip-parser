Overview
~~~~~~~~
BLLIP Parser is a statistical natural language parser including a
generative constituent parser (``first-stage``) and discriminative
maximum entropy reranker (``second-stage``). The latest version can be
found on `GitHub <https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser>`_. This
document describes basic usage of the command line interface and
describes how to build and run the reranking parser. There are now
`Python <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bllipparser/>`_ and Java interfaces
as well. The Python interface is described in ``README-python.rst``.

Compiling the parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. *(optional)* For optimal speed, you may want to define ``$GCCFLAGS``
   specifically for your machine. However, this step can be safely
   skipped as the defaults are usually fine. With ``csh`` or ``tcsh``,
   try something like::

     shell> setenv GCCFLAGS "-march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -mmmx"

   or::

     shell> setenv GCCFLAGS "-march=opteron -m64"

2. Build the parser with::

    shell> make

   -  Sidenote on compiling on OS X

      OS X uses the ``clang`` compiler by default which cannot currently
      compile the parser. Try setting this environment variable before
      building to change the default C++ compiler::

         shell> setenv CXX g++

      Recent versions of OS X may have additional issues. See issues
      `19 <http://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser/issues/19>`_ and `13
      <https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser/issues/13>`_ for more
      information.

Running the parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After it has been built, the parser can be run with::

    shell> parse.sh <sourcefile.txt>

For example::

    shell> parse.sh sample-text/sample-data.txt

The input text must be pre-sentence segmented with each sentence in an
``<s>`` tag::

    <s> Sentence 1 </s>
    <s> Sentence 2 </s>
    ...

Note that there needs to be a space before and after the sentence.

The parser distribution currently includes a basic Penn Treebank Wall
Street Journal parsing models which ``parse.sh`` will use by default. 
The Python interface to the parser includes a mechanism for listing and
downloading additional parsing models (some of which are more accurate,
depending on what you're parsing).

The script ``parse-eval.sh`` takes a list of treebank files as arguments
and extracts the terminal strings from them, runs the two-stage parser
on those terminal strings and then evaluates the parsing accuracy with
Sparseval. For example, if the Penn Treebank 3 is installed at
``/usr/local/data/Penn3/``, the following code evaluates the two-stage
parser on section 24::

   shell> parse-eval.sh /usr/local/data/Penn3/parsed/mrg/wsj/24/wsj*.mrg

The ``Makefile`` will attempt to automatically download and build
Sparseval for you if you run ``make sparseval``.

see this `paper
<http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2006/pdf/116_pdf.pdf>`_::

                Dorr, Bonnie and Johnson, Mark and Kahn, Jeremy G and

We no longer distribute `evalb <http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/>`_ with the
parser since it sometimes skips sentences unnecessarily. Sparseval does
not have these issues.

Parser details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For details on the running and training the parser, see
``first-stage/README.rst``. ``first-stage/TRAIN/README.rst`` includes
notes about how to retrain the parser and some information about the
parser model file formats.

Reranker details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See ``second-stage/README`` for an overview.
``second-stage/README-retrain.rst`` details how to retrain the reranker.
The ``second-stage/programs/*/README`` files include additional notes
about different reranker components.
